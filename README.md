## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This repository contains my STAT 652 project, which applies **linear regression modeling techniques** to a dataset.  
The project includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Model building and diagnostics
- Model selection using statistical criteria
- Visualization of model fits and diagnostics

## ðŸ›  Tools & Environment

- Developed in **RStudio**
- Report created using **Quarto**
- Libraries used include:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `broom`
  - Other standard R packages for regression analysis
